    <p>This week was pretty good. I spent a lot of time rushing for Heorot Hall, which looks very promising. The chapter president, Harry Gar, has been personally mentoring me this semester. He’s also on the football team, so I feel like I have a pretty good chance of getting in. His girlfriend has also been really helpful during rush. She let me drink from the keg first!</p>
    <p>In other news, our homecoming football game is next Friday.</p>
    <p>We’re playing against Mere University – our biggest competition to get to the playoffs. According to Harry, we have never (in the entire history of our university) defeated them. Their star quarterback, George Dell, is apparently super brutal. So many of our players have gotten hurt due to his violence. His mother, their coach, is also cutthroat and encourages her players to go to any lengths to win a game.</p>
    <p>Despite this, I am quite confident that we can defeat him this semester! I’m really hoping I can show Harry my commitment to both the team and Heorot Hall.</p>
    <p>It would kill me to let him down.</p>
