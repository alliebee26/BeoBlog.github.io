<p>WE BEAT MERE UNIVERSITY!</p>
<p>It was a really close game, and a few of our teammates got injured, but it is a historical win for our school! The winning blow came when I threw the ball so hard to a teammate that it broke Gren’s arm. Gren was trying to intercept my pass, but caught the ball all wrong. He was too focused on catching the ball, he didn’t realize he was about to run into one of his own teammates. His mom was furious. I really didn’t mean to! My head was so deep in the game that it didn’t register. After this play, we ended up winning the game by a touchdown. </p>
<p>We celebrated by going back to the fraternity house and having a party! Harry ended up giving me one of his football trophies from highschool to demonstrate how proud he was of me. I brought it back to my dorm for safekeeping. I was also accepted as a fraternity brother into Heorot Hall! It was a really special weekend for me, and I’m looking forward to winning even more games against our athletic rivals. I hear Gren’s mom has some complicated plays for our rematch next year. I’m looking forward to seeing what’s in store!</p>
<p>This entry concludes the requirements for my English class. This has been a great tool for storytelling, so I’ll probably keep this up after the assignment is completed.</p>
<p>See you next time!</p>
