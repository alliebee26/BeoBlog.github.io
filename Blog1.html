    <p>Hey!</p>
    <p>This is the first blog entry for my introductory English class. </p>
    <p>When I arrived on campus last week, I was personally welcomed by a warrior (weird name, but whatever) of Heorot Hall! He asked me some questions about my heritage since I’m a legacy to the frat, and told me he’d put a good word in with Harry Gar (the chapter’s president).</p>
    <p>I also met my roommate, Upton Ferth. He knows some players from my high school’s enemy team. Apparently, they told him some nasty rumors about my athletic ability or something, and it’s been on my mind all day. They told Upton I was the slowest swimmer on the swim team and barely made it to our state championship. I haven’t gotten the chance to explain why that is COMPLETELY untrue, but I’m hoping to explain at the Heorot Hall rush party tomorrow night!</p>
    <p>My classes so far have been fine, but I’m most looking forward to officially starting football practice. </p>
    <p>I’ll be the starting quarterback for the team as a freshman. It’s pretty rare for something like this to happen, but I have always been big for my age. I hope the other players don’t resent me for intruding on their team.</p>
