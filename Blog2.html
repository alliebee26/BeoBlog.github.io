    <p>I went to a Heorot Hall rush party last night!</p>
    <p>Harry bought a bunch of mead for the party, and we all sat on the benches together! It was a great opportunity to get to know the other members of the fraternity. The only downside was Upton’s presence. The fraternity brothers asked me to tell stories about my athletic escapades, and Upton kept trying to fact-check my stories. He would ask, “Did you really swim from France to New York? I think that sounds stupid.” And I had to say, “Yes, I did. I stopped in London for the One Direction concert, but I swam right to New York after.” I was so sick of him doubting my swimming that I stood on the table and told the entire story, with image references. I felt bad, but I had to demonstrate that I cannot be walked all over. Upton looked pretty crushed.</p>
    <p>This assurance made Harry call me the most promising pledge of the season! His girlfriend seemed hesitant about it, but I was completely stoked!! The rest of the party was great and I feel really good about Heorot Hall! Heorot Hall also includes almost all the football players, so I think they respect me and want me on the team!</p>
